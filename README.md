🧩 Introduction to Wireframing
📌 What is Wireframing?
Wireframing is the process of creating a simple visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a digital product, such as a website or application. It focuses on layout, structure, and functionality, rather than design details like colors, fonts, or images.

Wireframes are typically created during the early stages of the design process to help designers, developers, and stakeholders align on the structure and user flow of a product.

🎯 Importance in the Design Process
Wireframing is a critical step in the design workflow for several reasons:

Clarity: Helps define the structure and layout before the visual design is added.

Efficiency: Saves time and resources by identifying potential usability issues early.

Collaboration: Enables communication and feedback among team members and stakeholders.

User-Centered: Allows teams to focus on the user experience and functionality before polishing visuals.
